# LSTM_GNN
In this programme, we provides an idea on how to mining the interaction among long time series, and our work is under review in IEEE NNLS


During the training process, the input and output training samples are as follows. In Figure (a), we use the real signal amplitude information and the multivariate autoregressive model to iteratively generate multi-dimensional time series signals.
